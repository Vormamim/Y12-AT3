# SDM (Student Dashboard Manager) 

## Project Overview 
The system created allows users to enter student names and their marks for each subjects. Users can add multiple subject, with unique students and marks for each subject. This is then graphed on both a frequency histogram and a normal bar graph. Additionally, a summary of student performance is given. 

## How to Run the Program 
1. Open the contents of the zip file
2. Use the python file in your preferred IDE (for example Visual Studio code)
3. Login in with password and details if already an user, if not switch to sign up
4. Enter in a new subject to start

## Features 
- Add multiple marks per mark text box (e.g "Mark" : "70, 80") to forumulate an average for that student
- Graphs a frequency histogram of the data and a bar graph when "Show frequency histogram" is pressed and "Show individual marks" is pressed
- A performance summary is shown when "Calculate Performance" is pressed

## Imports 
- Run the requirements txt file in the terminal to add all libraries 
- If that does not work, download each library manually in the VS code terminal (e.g pip install matplotlib)
